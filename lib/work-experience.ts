/**
 * @fileoverview Work Experience Data and Utilities
 *
 * This file contains the centralized work experience data for the portfolio.
 * It supports multiple roles per company for promotion tracking.
 *
 * @example Adding a new company with single role:
 * ```typescript
 * {
 *   id: 4,
 *   company: "New Company Name",
 *   url: "https://newcompany.com",
 *   location: "City, Country",
 *   totalPeriod: "Jan 2024 – Present",
 *   roles: [
 *     {
 *       position: "Job Title",
 *       period: "Jan 2024 – Present",
 *       description: "Brief description of responsibilities",
 *       technologies: ["Tech1", "Tech2"],
 *       responsibilities: ["Task 1", "Task 2"]
 *     }
 *   ]
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @example Adding a company with promotion (multiple roles):
 * ```typescript
 * {
 *   id: 5,
 *   company: "Promoted Company",
 *   url: "https://promoted.com",
 *   location: "City, Country",
 *   totalPeriod: "Jan 2023 – Present",
 *   roles: [
 *     // Most recent role FIRST
 *     {
 *       position: "Senior Developer",
 *       period: "Jan 2024 – Present",
 *       description: "Current senior role description",
 *       technologies: ["React", "Node.js"],
 *       responsibilities: ["Lead development", "Mentor juniors"]
 *     },
 *     // Previous role SECOND
 *     {
 *       position: "Junior Developer",
 *       period: "Jan 2023 – Dec 2023",
 *       description: "Previous junior role description",
 *       technologies: ["JavaScript", "HTML"],
 *       responsibilities: ["Develop features", "Fix bugs"]
 *     }
 *   ]
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @example How to add to the array:
 * 1. Add new entry at the TOP of the workExperience array (most recent first)
 * 2. Update IDs sequentially (highest ID first)
 * 3. For promotions, add roles in reverse chronological order (newest first)
 * 4. Set isTemplate: true only for example/template entries
